# Securing Smart Homes: Threat & Vulnerability Analysis with AI Defense

## Overview
This repository contains the code and outputs related to my thesis titled **"Securing Smart Homes: Threat & Vulnerability Analysis with AI Defense."** The research focuses on analyzing potential vulnerabilities in smart home automation systems and developing AI-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) to enhance security.

### Abstract
The research presents a comprehensive risk analysis of smart home automation systems, highlighting the security risks associated with these systems' increasing prevalence. This study identifies vulnerabilities, quantifies risks, and employs AI models to detect potential attacks. The work also emphasizes ethical security testing, contributing actionable recommendations for enhancing the security of smart home ecosystems for homeowners, manufacturers, and policymakers.

### Major Contributions
1. **Vulnerability Identification**: Systematic cataloging of potential smart home vulnerabilities.
2. **Threat Analysis**: Comprehensive evaluation of the cybersecurity risks in smart home environments.
3. **Machine Learning Model Development**: Implemented several ML models for an Intrusion Detection System (IDS), including KNN, Decision Tree, and XGBoost.
4. **Actionable Insights**: Developed practical security recommendations for homeowners, manufacturers, and policymakers.
5. **Security Awareness**: Highlighted the importance of security in smart home adoption and provided measures to promote a secure ecosystem.

## Project Structure
The project consists of two main parts:
1. **Risk and Threat Analysis**: Explores the architecture, design, and configuration of smart home systems, analyzing how these factors contribute to security risks.
2. **Intrusion Detection System (IDS) Development**: Using machine learning models (KNN, Decision Tree, XGBoost) to detect suspicious activities, based on network data.

## Models and Code
- **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocessing steps for the Kaggle dataset.
- **Model Training**: Implementation of KNN, Decision Tree, and XGBoost for the IDS.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Outputs and performance metrics of the models, including accuracy, precision, and recall, F1-score.

## Actions After Suspicious Activity Detection
- **Isolating Infected Machines**: Preventing further network damage by isolating compromised devices.
- **Blocking Malicious Traffic**: Enhancing data and device security by blocking harmful traffic.
- **Reporting Security Breaches**: Providing detailed reports for further investigation by network administrators or homeowners.

## Recommendations
The research provides valuable recommendations for:
- **Homeowners**: Practical advice for securing smart home devices.
- **Manufacturers**: Suggestions for improving the security features of smart home products.
- **Policymakers**: Guidelines for developing regulations to safeguard smart home ecosystems.
